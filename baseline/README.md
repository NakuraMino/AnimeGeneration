# Establishing a Baseline 

We decided to see what results we can get with a vanilla neural style transfer technique. We use the neural style transfer 
homework assignment from Coursera to establish a baseline of what the images will look like when using an anime photo as the 
style image. 

Note that the Coursera assignment uses a CPU, not a GPU.
